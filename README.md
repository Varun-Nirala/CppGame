Games using C++ and SFML
========================

To create a Visual Studio Solution integrated with SFML
Download, unzip and copy SFML to a particular location for example:
	1. D:/Varun/Varun_Wrok/Libs    [Extracted folder name SFML-2.5.1]
	2. Update the same in CMakeLists.txt.
	
Then just use CMakeLists.txt to creat a solution. No extra linking or anything required.
